# Tutorial Structure

We decided to structure our tutorials into two categories.  The first
teaches basic ideas of Factor like how the Stack works or how to write
Words.  They also include an example that showcases the given idea in
action.  Our current set of tutorials that belong to this first set
are on the following topics:
 - [The Stack](../../../the-stack.md)
 - [Words](../../../words.md)
 - [Vocabularies](../../../vocabularies.md)
 - [Quotation and Combinators](../../../quotations_combinators.md)
 
The second set combines these basic ideas and
shows how one might approach coding a more complicated program.
We currently only have one tutorial for this set called ["Super Hello
World"](Super_Hello_World.md) which walks through how someone might write a function which
prints something a certain number of times based on an input.  You can
see a short summary of each tutorial in the [Tutorial Summaries](tutorials.md) section 
of this report. We also have a ["Table of Contents"](../../../Table_of_Contents.md) section which gives
a short description of each tutorial so that users can easily find which
tutorial might be most beneficial to them.  We also have an ["Other Resources"](../../../Resources.md)
section which has a small collection of resources we consulted and found
helpful when learning Factor.

Our tutorials are being held on our Factor Online Platform along with
our interpreter and Foogle.  These two other aspects of the platform
help to make the tutorials more interactive.  When reading through the
tutorials, one can type sample code directly into the interpreter
to see what exactly each new line of Factor code introduced in the
tutorial does.  In addition, certain snippets of code allow the user
to click on it in order to have it copied into the interpreter.  This
way a user can see how exactly the piece of code should be written, as
well as quickly see what a snippet of code does if they do not want to
type it themselves.  We hope that the ease of running example code
helps sidestep some common beginner mistakes like missing spaces or
semicolons with little frustration.
