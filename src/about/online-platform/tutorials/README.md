When we began learning Factor, we started by following the "Your First
Program" tutorial within the Listener.  This tutorial taught us the
basics of Factor, however after we completed it, we werenâ€™t sure where
to go next.  Scouring the internet led us to only a few other learning
resources.  Thus, we felt that it was important that we create new
Factor tutorials as well as catalog some other useful resources for
new learners to jump into Factor easily.
