# Tutorials

When we began learning Factor, we started by following the ["Your First
Program"](https://docs.factorcode.org/content/article-first-program.html) tutorial within the Listener.  This tutorial taught us the
basics of Factor however, after we completed it we weren’t sure where
to go next.  There are a handful of beginner level resources that we found online. In fact, we cataloged many of these other resources in our [“Other Resources”](../../../Resources.md) section.  We decided that creating more tutorials could only help entice new factor programmers.  We have a listing of all our tutorials in our ["Table of Contents"](../../../Table_of_Contents.md).
