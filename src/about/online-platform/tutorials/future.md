## Future work

There are several aspects of our collection of tutorials that we would
like to improve.  The first is that we would like to create more
tutorials which expand on the basic ideas we have taught and write
more complicated programs like the Super Hello Word tutorial.  We
think that showcasing the creation of more complicated projects will
not only show new Factor programers how to approach building larger
Factor, but show off what Factor is capable of.

The second addition we would make is to ensure that every line of code
presented in the tutorial can be run in the interpreter.  As of right
now a good chunk of the code in the tutorials can be run on the
interpreter.  However there are still some features of Factor which
have not been implemented into the interpreter meaning if one was to
follow the tutorials, they would need to have installed Factor on
their computer.  It would make the learning experience much smoother
if we could type every line straight into the online interpreter.

Another thing we would like to incorporate into our tutorials is user
feedback.  Our tutorials have yet to be tested on new factor learners.
We believe that giving these tutorials to new factor programmers and
then receiving their feedback will allow us to target areas of the
tutorials that are lacking.
