## Tutorial Summaries  
We have a quick summary of each of the current the tutorials below:

#### [The Stack](the-stack.md):
This tutorial explains the concept of the stack as well as how Factor Programming revolves around it.  We explain how one pushes and pops items from the stack and how a function applied to the stack will work.  We also give the user a collection of simple words which allow users to manipulate objects on the stack (dup, drop, swap … ect).
#### [Words](words.md):
In this section, we explain that Factor’s version of functions are known as words.  We then go on to explain how to write and use words.  Specifically, we go into depth about how to specify the correct number of inputs and outputs a word will have and how words manipulate inputs to produce a desired output.  We also walkthrough the process of writing a word step by step.
#### [Vocabularies](vocabularies.md):
Here, we explore vocabularies and how they are essentially Factor’s version of a library.  This tutorial shows how to import entire vocabularies or single words from vocabularies to use in projects.
#### [Quotations and Combinators](quotations_combinators.md): 
This tutorial covers quotations and combinators.  It shows users how to push blocks of code to the stack, and how combinators can make use of them as inputs.  It then showcases quotations and combinators in action with a walkthrough that shows the creation of a word which outputs a certain term in the fibonacci sequence based on a given input.  We believe that this section should highlight quotations and combinators as important tools when developing complex programs.
#### [Super Hello World](Super_Hello_World.md):
This tutorial is inspired by the Hello World tutorial that every programming language seems to have.  After learning how to write a program that prints “hello world”, we then learn how to write a more complicated program which prints “hello world” a specific number of times.  This section explores the thought process a Factor programer might go through when writing code.  This tutorial also acts as a review of the previous sections.
