# The online Factor interpreter

Suppose you're a newcomer to Factor (maybe you are), looking to try
out Factor because you read on some John guy's blog post about
interesting language/syntax features that Factor has or simply because
you wanted to get a feel for what it was like to write Factor code.

In order to do that, you would first have to download and install
Factor on your computer—either from Factor's website, or by cloning
Factor's GitHub repository and compiling Factor from source.  To be
sure, doing so is not _difficult_—but for many users who are merely
looking to experiment with Factor, having to go through the entire
download/install process is enough to discourage them from trying
Factor.

The solution, inspired by existing tools for many other popular
languages (e.g., the Go Playground, Repl.it, JSFiddle, Try Haskell)
and various online coding course platforms (e.g., Codeacademy, Khan
Academy, freeCodeCamp), is a [_web-based interpreter_ for
Factor](https://factor.netlify.com).  A web-based Factor interpreter
removes the aforementioned accessibility barrier: to get started with
Factor, a user does not need to download or install anything—only
navigate to the Factor interpreter website (at
[factor.netlify.com](https://factor.netlify.com))—and they can start
exploring right away.
