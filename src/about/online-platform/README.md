# The Factor online platform

Factor is a great programming language, but has yet to break into the
mainstream. We think that improving the learning process will help to
improve its rate of adoption. Our online platform targets three such
aspects that could make the language more inviting to new programmers:
[lowering the installation barrier](interpreter/README.md), [adding
more tutorials](tutorials/README.md) and learning materials, and
creating [a documentation search engine](foogle/README.md).
